This is a Bonus Challenge for week 4:

"Splinter Challenge"
Create a JavaScript file named 'script.js' and add a 'splinter' function. The function should take in 2 numbers as arguments, multiply those numbers, and save the result to a locally scoped variable called 'z'. Next, create an array that stores the first argument, second argument, and z. Return that array.

Try testing this by console logging the splinter function, passing in 1 and 2.

Check all of this in to a repo called "prime_prestudy_bonus_week_04"
